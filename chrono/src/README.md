# chrono

Code developed by CTAG, and optimized for Eurobench by CTAG on Tecnalia
proposal.

## Installation guidelines

Follow the upper [Readme](../README.md) indications.

## Description

### Abstract
This code developed in Octave demonstrates the task completion time.

The current entry point is [computePI.m](computePI.m).

```octave
computePI("[path_to]/subject_xx_run_xx_chrono.csv", "[path_to]/")
```

The two parameters are:

- `subject_xx_run_xx_chrono.csv`: a `csv` file containing the time stamp raw
  data that is generated by the testbed.  

### Variables

entryTime: time when person enters the testbed

exitTime: time when person exits the testbed

## Initial code structure

The current documentation may not be updated.

Brief code structure is listed below:

| Metric | Input | Expected units | Variable name | Format | Data Example | Input file | information MAP |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Chrono | Time | seconds (s) | rawData | Double | 0.5, 3, 59, 120 ... | subject_xx_run_xx_chrono.csv | proximitySensor>TestEd> nodeRed >rawData_T_TestID_RunNumber_timestamp.csv> preProcess>inputFile |

Octave algorithm to obtain the cycle time/task completion time. The algorithm return a 
scalar value.
