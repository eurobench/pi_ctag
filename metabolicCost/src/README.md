## Description

### Abstract
This code developed in Octave demonstrates how to predict the metabolic rate 
in kilocalories (kcal) of a human being performing different tasks.

The current entry point is [computePI.m](computePI.m).

```octave
computePI("[path_to]/subject_xx_run_xx_chrono.csv",
"[path_to]/subject_xx_testbed_lowAssist.yaml", "[path_to]/")
```

The two parameters are:

- `subject_xx_run_xx_chrono.csv`: a `csv` file containing the time stamp raw
  data that is generated by the testbed. 

- 'subject_xx_testbed_lowAssist.yaml': a 'yaml' file that contails all the
  necessary user inputs to select the correct posture/sub posture to calculate
the metabolic cost in kcal. 

### Variables

s: gender of the subject (1-male, 0-female) [user input in yaml file]

Octave algorithm to obtain the metabolic cost of the task during both static and
dynamic tasks.
First we calculate the time of completion of the task.
Secondly the switch statement are used to select the opt1 casescand then 
we define two functions based on the static and dynamic tasks:
1. postureMaintain that calculates the metabolic cost based on body static 
postures. The function inputs are body weight and the Opt1a. 
2. otherTasks that calculates the metabolic cost nased on dynamic tasks. The
   function inputs all variables [see above] except opt1.
